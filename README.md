# CECS-323
All of the labs and assignments from my CECS 323 course. I am currently taking this course, so there will be constant updates.

I know that there are you people who just look up codes on Github in order to cheat on your assignments. That is extremely bad practice (obviously)! Because of that, I left out most of my answers on my files. Figure it out for yourself ;)
